Open cmd in that main folder "My-codes"
If it's a brand new folder / App then write command = git init
Then enter= git add . ( For uplaoding all the files and folder in there as it is on GitHub )
Check Status = git status
Now = git commit -m " My Initial Commit ( Anything )"
Command = git log (will show the previous commits) OR git log --oneline
Now, everytime you make changes to the code, just write command = git add . and then check status by = git status to see that files have been modified
Wallah, You are done!!!
